<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I love history and education. I love to learn and read and transported to other centuries.</p>

<p>Music is also highly regarded in our house. There is just no better feeling than making beautiful or fun music together with family</p>

<p>As I have the very important task of feeding my family, I have the responsability of making sure only real food goes into their bellies,
  which is why we grow our own fruits and vegetables the most we can.</p>
